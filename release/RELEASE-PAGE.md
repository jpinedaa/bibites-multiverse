# Bibites Multiverse `@@RELEASE@@`

Connect your Bibites world to a shared map. Organisms can move between the worlds on the map.
Your game and saves stay on your computer.

## What you need

- Windows: nothing else. The recommended setup includes The Bibites `0.6.3.1`.
- Linux: nothing else. The recommended package includes the native game.

Every participant package includes `public-map.json`, the public join configuration. It contains
the deployed HTTPS enrollment and WSS relay addresses. During installation, each package creates
a unique world identity and secret. It does not reuse one shared credential.

A private join string contains the map address, world identity, and secret. Do not post one in an
issue, screenshot, or log.

## Downloads

| Platform | File | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
@@COMPLETE_DOWNLOAD_ROWS@@| Windows add-on | [`@@ZIP_NAME@@`](https://github.com/@@REPO@@/releases/download/@@TAG@@/@@ZIP_NAME@@) | `@@ZIP_SHA256@@` |
| Linux add-on | [`@@LINUX_ZIP_NAME@@`](https://github.com/@@REPO@@/releases/download/@@TAG@@/@@LINUX_ZIP_NAME@@) | `@@LINUX_ZIP_SHA256@@` |

## Windows

1. Download the **Windows setup** executable (recommended).
2. Make sure that its SHA-256 matches the table.
3. Open the setup properties and select **Unblock** when Windows shows that option.
4. Double-click the setup executable.

This community setup is not code-signed. Windows can show **Unknown publisher**. Continue only
after the setup SHA-256 matches this page.

The GUI selects the included portable game. You can instead use a game it finds on your machine
or select the folder yourself. **Start after installation** is selected by default. The game opens
after the map grants this installation a place. Setup creates desktop and Start Menu launch icons.
It also registers Bibites Multiverse in Windows Settings for uninstall.

The Windows complete ZIP remains available for advanced or script-based installation. It opens
the same GUI through `Install-BibitesMultiverse.cmd`.

## Linux

1. Download and extract the **Linux complete** archive (recommended).
2. Make sure that its SHA-256 matches the table.
3. Run `./install-bibites-multiverse.sh` from the extracted directory.

The Linux installer uses the included native game and enrolls this installation automatically.
The add-on archive finds an existing itch.io game. For a private map, pass
`--join-string-file ./join.txt`.

## Defaults

The installed world exchanges organisms on all four edges. It saves every 10 minutes, keeps six
saves, and saves when the game closes.

The public map operates from 2026-08-14 through 2026-11-14. The operator can announce an
extension before the end date.

the [join guide](https://github.com/@@REPO@@/blob/@@TAG@@/docs/participant/join.md) for details.
